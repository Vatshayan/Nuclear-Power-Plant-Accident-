Data Visulaization of Nuclear power plants accidents and Different Machine learning Algorithms are applied for analyzing and reducing risk and accident in Power plants

Here is the dataset of 216 incidents and accidents occurring at nuclear power plants compiled and analysed within the papers:

‘Reassessing the safety of nuclear power’ by Spencer Wheatley, Benjamin Sovacool and Didier Sornette published in the May issue of the journal Energy Research and Social Science.

‘Of Disasters and Dragon Kings: A Statistical Analysis of Nuclear Power Incidents and Accidents’ by Spencer Wheatley, Benjamin Sovacool and Didier Sornette, published in the May issue of the journal Risk Analysis.

We intend to continually improve the quality of the data — and its analysis — by encouraging the public to review and contribute to the data set. We will review this feedback and publish updated versions of the data for the public to see and use. Soon there will be a more interactive application for this, complete with sources and transparent calculations for the costs. In the meantime, please send any criticisms, modifications, or additions that you may have in mind to nucleardatabase@gmail.com.
